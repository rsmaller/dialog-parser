# Dialog Parser Project
<p>This is a little gift for Jason and Andy.</p>
<p>My coding bros!</p>

<h2>What This Is All About</h2>
<p>This is a project written entirely in C partially for the purpose of understanding how nodes, pointers, and GitHub work.</p>
<p>The other half of this was for me to be funny and make a few laughs.</p>
